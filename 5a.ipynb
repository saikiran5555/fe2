    "Using Min-Max scaling in preprocessing for a food delivery service recommendation system is a strategic approach to normalize the features such as price, rating, and delivery time. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the recommendation algorithm, which is particularly important if these features vary in scale and units. Here’s how you can implement Min-Max scaling in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the Dataset: Examine the range of values for each feature - price, rating, and delivery time. For instance, prices might range from $5 to $50, ratings from 1 to 5 stars, and delivery times from 15 to 60 minutes.\n",

    "Integrate Scaled Features into the Dataset: Replace the original values of price, rating, and delivery time with their scaled values. This transformation puts all features on a similar scale, with 0 representing the minimum and 1 the maximum value for each feature.\n",

    "Proceed with Model Training: Use these scaled features to train your recommendation model. Since all features are now on a similar scale, the model won't be unduly influenced by one feature's large range.\n",

    "Consistency in Further Data Processing: Apply the same scaling to any new data entering the system using the original min and max values to maintain consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying Min-Max scaling, each feature (price, rating, delivery time) will contribute equally to the distance calculations in the recommendation algorithm, ensuring that one feature does not dominate the recommendation due to its scale. This is particularly important in algorithms that rely on distance calculations, like K-Nearest Neighbors, or when using regularization in linear models.\n",
