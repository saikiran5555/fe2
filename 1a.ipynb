    "Min-Max scaling is a technique used in data preprocessing to normalize or scale feature values. The goal is to transform the values of a numeric feature so they fall within a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. This is particularly useful when features have different scales and you are using algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input data, like gradient descent-based algorithms or distance-based algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",

    "Example of Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with a feature \"Age\" having values in the range of 20 to 60 years. To apply Min-Max scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Identify min and max:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Age (min) = 20\n",
    "Maximum Age (max) = 60\n",
    "Step 2: Rescale each value:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "40\n",
    "10\n",
    "\n",
    " =0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an Age of 30 gets scaled to 0.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying this scaling, all the values of the Age feature will be transformed to a scale from 0 to 1. A 20-year-old would be at 0, a 60-year-old at 1, and all other ages proportionally in between.\n",
    "Advantages of Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency in Scale: Brings all features to the same scale, ensuring that no feature dominates the model due to its scale.\n",
    "Preserves Relationships: The scaling preserves the relationships among the original data values since it's a linear transformation.\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to Outliers: Min-Max scaling is sensitive to outliers. A single large or small value can significantly distort the scaled values.\n",
    "Not Centered: This scaling doesn’t center the data and, hence, does not handle skewed distributions well."
